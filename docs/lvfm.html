      <h2> Univariate Example </h2>
      <p> We begin our discussion with the simple case of a single latent force model of the form
      $$
         \dot{x}(t) = - D x(t) + f(t), 
      $$
      where $f(t)$ is a Gaussian process with a squared exponential kernel. The ODE above is solved easily giving
      $$
        x(t) = x_0 e^{-D t} + \int_0^{t} e^{-D(t - \tau) } f(\tau) d\tau.
      $$
      Which tells us that $x(t)$ is a linear transformation of a Gaussian process and therefore is itself a Gaussian process! With a new kernel
      new kernel given by convolution of the original kernel. This result immediately gives the required analytic tractability - 
      this being a consequence of the linear structure of the ODE.

      It can be shown that for a diagonal system of first order linear differential equations with Gaussian processes forcing functions $f_r(t)$ defined by
      $$
        \frac{y_q(t)}{dt} + D_q y_q(t) = B_q + \sum_{r=1}^{R} S_{rq} f_r(t)
      $$
      For linear ODE's with constant coefficients the formal solution of this sytem can be expressed by a linear integral operator, therefore 
      $y(t)$ is itself a Gaussian process with a covariance function given by convolution of the initial covariance function. It is also worth
      noting that for a system of equations not necessarily in diagonal form we can proceed by
      
      \begin{align}
        y = x
      \end{align}
